Tired of *inconcise language* in *lengthy articles*? Repeatedly having to search up *technical jargon*? Irritated from finding inexplicite *citations*? Look no further, as Research Mode can ease that all for you, with features such as
* Automated **term (jargon)** highlighting and defining
* A Google Docs-like **note taker** in a convenient sidebar saved to the cloud
* An optimized **reader mode**
* Text **simplification**
* Auto-generated **citations** (under construction)
* **Semantic searching** within an article or paper (under construction)
* Automatic **summarization** and **notes generation** (under construction)

## Accelerate Research <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f52c.png" alt="microscope" width="25"/>

This project was built out of the frustrations of dealing with poorly formatted articles, inconsise text, and the overexcessive technical terms from jargon-ful fields such as in app development, machine learning and medical research projects. 

## Reader Mode <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4d6.png" alt="book" width="25"/>
A number of websites use illegible fonts or sizes, and reader mode is not provided on all sites. Thus, reader mode was also added which sets the character sizes and line widths to a proven optimal size for reading and removes ads. 

## Note Taker <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" alt="memo" width="25"/>
Being tired of either screen splitting or having multiple tabs open and consequently forgetting my thoughts every time I switch tabs between my notes and my article, I decided to integrate the note taker into a sidebar. Consequently, this also allows for content-aware automated annotations such as auto-generated bibliographies

The project is still under construction. My goal is to finish a majority of it by the end of summmer.
